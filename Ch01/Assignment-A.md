<br>**A**. 9

**Q**. What should be the value of rng2, such that the code block above prints 91?
<br>**A**. 7

**Q**. What is the sum of the two values to which rng3 can be set such that the output above is 364?

**Q**. What does g.greet(lout=False) prints above?
<br>**A**. HELLO, FRED!

**Q**. What should a[0] be set equal to such that print(sum(sum(a) * sum(b))) prints 420?
<br>**A**. 15

**Q**. Is it guaranteed that print(np.prod(e)) will always be less than 1?
<br>**A**. Yes, since np.random.random returns values between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 not included

**Q**. At which index of a, 99 values is stored? 
<br>**A**. At 0, 2

**Q**. What is the value of the square-root of sum of the dot product between y and the square-root of x? (answer up to 5 decimal points only, e.g. 0.12345)
<br>**A**. <pre>
    [[15.39230 19.07107] 
    [20.85641 25.89950]]
</pre>
       
**Q**. What is the sum of all the elements of x and square-root of dot-product of sum of each coloumn of x and sum of each row of x? (answer up to 5 decimal points only, e.g. 0.12345)
<br>**A**. Sum of all elements = 10
<br>Sqrt = 7.34847

**Q**. Which box value shall be used in img.crop such that the colorful Python Logo is completely visible?
<br>**A**. box7

**Q**. Which Operation will hide the Colorful Python logo completely?
<br>**A**. operation4

**Q**. Numpy Axies are (y, x), where as PIL axies are (x, y). True or False?
<br>**A**. true

**Q**. From the options available below, which operation will give us "other" gradient? (Other means if we got x-gradient above then y-gradients and vice-verse)
<br>**A**. newimg = npimg[:, :-1] - npimg[:, 1:]

**Q**. Which kernel among these options will give us horizontal edge?
<br>**A**. Technically,all 4 of them but the first one is similar to the one used for vertical one.

**Q**. What would this kernel do?
<br>kernel = 1/9*np.float32([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])
<br>**A**. Blurs the image

**Q**. What would this kernel do?
<br>kernal = np.float32([[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]])
<br>**A**. Prints the same image as is

**Q**. Which is the below is correct way of average the channels to get grayscale image?
<br>**A**. Both are same
